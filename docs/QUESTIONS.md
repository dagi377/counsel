## Q-001 Vite and Vitest for web/

- Task: T-001.4
- Sources: AGENTS.md "Allowed dependencies" (Front end: TypeScript, React only); T-001.4 accept.
- Reading A: the front end may use only TypeScript and React, with no build or test tool.
- Reading B: web/ needs a bundler and a unit-test runner; feature tasks (e.g. T-035L.3) name Vitest.
- Proposed: allow Vite (build, dev server, `import.meta.glob` feature discovery) and Vitest
  (unit tests) as dev tooling for web/ only, plus @vitejs/plugin-react and TypeScript types.
  T-001.4 also adds a `web-test` target to the Makefile (not in its file list) so `make check`
  runs `npm --prefix web test`; it installs web/node_modules when missing. web/package-lock.json
  is not committed by T-001.4 because it is not in the task's file list; versions are pinned exactly.
